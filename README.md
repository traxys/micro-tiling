# Micro-Tiling

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/micro-tiling/badge/?version=latest)](https://micro-tiling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

An API capable of generating mosaics, based on micro services.

A running API is on `https://micro-tiling.tk/`. The documentation is availaible as a [html file](swagger_api/index.html).
You need ensicoins to run it, when the API state is needing it. You can get some on the [explorer](https://explorer.ensicoin.tk/), indeed currently all coinbases are spendable by everyone.
Check out a [CLI for paying transactions](https://github.com/EnsicoinDevs/ensicoincoin-cli). Here is a presentation of what the micro-services do and how they communicate
